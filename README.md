## Validation of Precursor Ion Annotations Obtained with *de novo* Approaches
Cancer is assumed to be one of the major causes of death. One of the major proteins involved in adaptive cancer immune response is major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I. Molecules produced by MHC class I, are called antigen presentation peptides, and they can undertake by mutations during cancerogenesis. Therefore, it is essential to discover ways to establish these peptides' sequences.

Mass spectrometry is broadly used to recognize specific molecules in the sample. Nowadays, this method is a routine way to reconstruct the precise structure of proteins. An essential part of the mass spectrometry is the analysis of the obtained data. This process can be performed by *de novo *approaches. In this work, *de novo* sequencing technique is used to validate mass spectrometry results.
